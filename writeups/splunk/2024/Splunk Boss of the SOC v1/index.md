#Splunk Boss of the SOC v1

## Scenario : Advanced Persistent Threat

### Question 1 
<b>"What IP is scanning our web server?"</b>

Navigate to http://10.10.29.30:8000 and then click on **Investigating with Splunk Workshop**.

We know:
 * We have a compromised website: imreallynotbatman.com
 * An index called: botsv1

Lets start with a basic search:

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com
```

This provides ~80,0000 results.

![](img/1.jpg)

Something that is scanning our webserver is likely to be via HTTP, so lets set sourcetype to **stream:http**.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http"
```

![](img/2.jpg)

Lets see how many different ip addresses we are dealing with.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" | stats count by src_ip
```

![](img/3.jpg)

We can assume that due to the volume of traffic, this source ip is scanning our server.

> Answer: **40.80.148.42**

### Question 2
<b>"What web scanner scanned the server?"</b>

Looking at some of the traffic from 40.80.148.42, we can see it is running Acunetix - a vulnerability scanner.

![](img/4.jpg)

> Answer: **Acunetix**

### Question 3
<b>"What is the IP address of our web server?"</b>

The requests from 40.80.148.42 are targetting 192.168.250.70

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="40.80.148.42" | stats count by dest_ip
```

![](img/5.jpg)

> Answer: **192.168.250.70**

### Question 4
<b>"What content management system is imreallynotbatman.com using?"</b>

Looking at the dest_headers we can see that Joomla is likely to be the CMS in use.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="40.80.148.42" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" | top limit=20 dest_headers
```

![](img/6.jpg)

> Answer: **Joomla**

### Question 5
<b>"What address is performing the brute-forcing attack against our website?"</b>

A brute force attack is against some form of authentication. This will likely require GET/POST requests.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" | stats count by http_method
```

![](img/7.jpg)

Looking at the http_content for a request shows that the password field is called **passwd**.

![](img/8.jpg)

Refining our search further shows how many requests are coming from each ip.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | stats count by src_ip
```

![](img/9.jpg)

Listing **form_data** shows a brute force attempt on the **admin** user.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="23.22.63.114" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | top limit=20 form_data
```

![](img/10.jpg)

> Answer: **23.22.63.114**

### Question 6
<b>"What was the first password attempted in the attack?"</b>

The earliest entry will be at the **tail**.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="23.22.63.114" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | tail 1
```

![](img/11.jpg)

> Answer: **12345678**

### Quesion 7
<b>"One of the passwords in the brute force attack is James Brodsky's favorite Coldplay song. Which six character song is it?"</b>

This is an interesting query as we need to separate the passwords from the form_data.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="23.22.63.114" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| table form_data
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| table passwd 
| regex passwd= \w{6}
```

There is still 343 possibilities, sorting alphabetically reveals the answer.

![](img/12.jpg)

> Answer: **yellow**

### Question 8
<b>"What was the correct password for admin access to the content management system running imreallynotbatman.com?"</b>

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| stats count by passwd
| where count>1
```

![](img/13.jpg)

> Answer: **batman**

### Question 9
<b>"What was the average password length used in the password brute forcing attempt rounded to closest whole integer?"</b>

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| eval length=len(passwd) 
| stats avg(length)
```

![](img/14.jpg)

> Answer: **6**

### Question 10
<b>"How many seconds elapsed between the time the brute force password scan identified the correct password and the compromised login rounded to 2 decimal places?"</b>

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd  | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)"  | search passwd=batman 
| transaction passwd 
| eval dur=round(duration, 2)
| table dur
```

![](img/15.jpg)

> Answer: **92.17**

### Question 11
<b>"How many unique passwords were attempted in the brute force attempt?"</b>

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| stats count by passwd
```

![](img/16.jpg)

> Answer: **412**

### Question 12 
<b>"What is the name of the executable uploaded by P01s0n1vy?"</b>

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" form-data
```

![](img/17.jpg)

> Answer: **3791.exe**

### Question 13
<b>"What is the MD5 hash of the executable uploaded?"</b>

```
index=botsv1 3791.exe md5 sourcetype="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" CommandLine="3791.exe" 
| rex field="_raw" "MD5=(?<hash>\w+)"

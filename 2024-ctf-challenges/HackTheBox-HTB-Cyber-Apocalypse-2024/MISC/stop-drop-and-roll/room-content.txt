===== THE FRAY: THE VIDEO GAME =====
Welcome!
This video game is very simple
You are a competitor in The Fray, running the GAUNTLET
I will give you one of three scenarios: GORGE, PHREAK or FIRE
You have to tell me if I need to STOP, DROP or ROLL
If I tell you there's a GORGE, you send back STOP
If I tell you there's a PHREAK, you send back DROP
If I tell you there's a FIRE, you send back ROLL
Sometimes, I will send back more than one! Like this: 
GORGE, FIRE, PHREAK
In this case, you need to send back STOP-ROLL-DROP!

// then will ask user to input y/n
Are you ready? (y/n)

// After that the game begin

Ok then! Let's go!

// if it is just single

What do you do? ROLL // user-input
